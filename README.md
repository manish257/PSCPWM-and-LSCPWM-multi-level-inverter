# PSCPWM-and-LSCPWM-multi-level-inverter

Task 1
Based on your chosen values of both input voltage sources and load power,
determine the electrical ratings of all the switches and show them in tabular
form.

Task 2
Implement Phase Shifted Carrier Based PWM (PSCPWM) for the 5-level,
7-level and 9-level inverter, obtain the output voltage waveform at each stage
and then resultant voltage waveform. Do not forget to include the waveforms
of each gate pulse. Perform FFT analysis on the Simulink and determine
Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the voltage.

Task 3
Implement Level Shifted Carrier Based PWM (LSCPWM) for the 5-level, 7-
level and 9-level inverter, obtain the output voltage waveform at each stage
and then resultant voltage waveform. Do not forget to include the waveforms
of each gate pulse. Perform FFT analysis on the Simulink and determine
Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the voltage.

Task 4
Connect a resistive load and obtain the waveforms of output voltage and
output current.

Task 5
Connect an RL load and obtain the waveforms of output voltage and output
current.
